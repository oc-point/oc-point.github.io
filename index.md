Our goal is to provide a safe, non-judgmental environment where issues can be discussed, strengths recognized, and solutions implemented. We have worked with individuals of all ages, couples, and families with issues including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, ADHD, PTSD, job loss, relationships/divorce, illness, Alzheimer’s, and forgiveness. Call us today ({{site.phone}}) and together, we can start the healing process.
