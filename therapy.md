## Information on Therapy, Therapists, and Psychologists

If you are new to psychotherapy, it is normal to have many questions on what it is and how it can help. Ocean Point Counseling will be more than happy to answer your questions. However, if you want to do your own research, we recommend the American Psychological Associationâ€™s (APA) website. The APA website goes into depth regarding most questions you may have. It discusses the training that clinicians receive, things you should expect from your therapist, what to expect during therapy, myths about therapy, and much more. Here are some good resources we think will be helpful:

{% for item in site.data.apa_links %}
  <b><a href="{{item.link}}" target="_blank">{{item.name}}</a></b><br>
  <i>{{item.description}}</i><br>
{% endfor %}

We highly recommend that you use the APA's resources to find out the information you need. However, Ocean Point Counseling would be happy to talk to you about any questions you may have. Call today at {{site.phone}}.
